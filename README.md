## Description

The VIP Architect Template for Xcode is a helpful tool for iOS developers who want to follow the VIP architectural pattern in their projects. The VIP pattern encourages a clear separation of responsibilities within your app, making it easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

Key features of this template include:

- **View:** This module is responsible for user interface components and interactions. It is where you design your user interface and handle user inputs.

- **Interactor:** The interactor module contains the business logic of your app. It communicates with data sources, performs computations, and manages the app's core functionality.

- **Presenter:** The presenter module acts as an intermediary between the view and interactor. It takes data from the interactor and formats it for display in the view. It also handles user input validation and presentation logic.
