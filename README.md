# Cleab VIP Template

Clean Swift (a.k.a VIP) is Uncle Bobâ€™s Clean Architecture applied to iOS and Mac projects. The Clean Swift Architecture is not a framework. It is a set of Xcode templates to generate the Clean Architecture components for you. That means you have the freedom to modify the templates to suit your needs.
